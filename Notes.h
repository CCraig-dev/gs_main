/*

$$$1: TODO reflect changes: 
	A: Teacher.h to match DD
	B: only answers, no questions for now (reflect in DD)
	C: reflect changes in DD (q/a now in vector, not map)
	D: reflect changes in DD (no private EvalHelper in class)
$$$3: Set standards
****4: TOOO assignment - set Key, score vector for students

II: Database concerns
	1: What happens if searching out of index or availability?
	2: It's easy to have linked duplicates.  Would that also unnecessarily duplicate searches?

TODO: Finish imagemanager

III: Image Evaluator -> modify to work with new image, and apply needed changes
		(more to be added as needed)
