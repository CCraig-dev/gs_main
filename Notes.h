/*

$$$1: TODO reflect changes: 
	A: Teacher.h to match DD
	B: only answers, no questions for now (reflect in DD)
	C: reflect changes in DD (q/a now in vector, not map)
	D: reflect changes in DD (no private EvalHelper in class)
$$$3: Set standards

I: TODO
	A: Better ID-maker in GS
	C: Finish GSM printresults()


	A: Make table/db clearing function in DBM
	B: Clear table/db at onset after load in GS



II: Database concerns
	1: What happens if searching out of index or availability? (or at a table that doesn't exist)
		-> BREAKS if asking for something that doesn't exist
	2: It's easy to have linked duplicates.  Would that also unnecessarily duplicate searches?



III: Image Evaluator -> modify to work with new image, and apply needed changes
		(more to be added as needed)
