/*

$$$1: TODO reflect changes: 
	A: Teacher.h to match DD
	B: only answers, no questions for now (reflect in DD)
	C: reflect changes in DD (q/a now in vector, not map)
	D: reflect changes in DD (no private EvalHelper in class)
$$$3: Set standards

I: TODO
	AA1: Finish standard deviation
	AA2: Test ALL the things!

	A: Verify: store answers after directly after grading - good or bad idea?
		-- may be easier to work with at higher level before saving
			-- Next change, clean up to reflect change - db work goes in GSM
	B: Verify - clean up database by getting fullset of data immediately?

II: Database concerns
	1: What happens if searching out of index or availability? (or at a table that doesn't exist)
		-> BREAKS if asking for something that doesn't exist
	2: It's easy to have linked duplicates.  Would that also unnecessarily duplicate searches?
	


III: Image Evaluator -> modify to work with new image, and apply needed changes
		(more to be added as needed)
